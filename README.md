# Introduction
Buhlmann ZHL-16C is commonly used in diving computers with gradient factor parameters. Selecting these parameters is not that straight forward, and same parameters should not be used for all diving profiles. This project aims to guide users to select the correct parameters for their planned dive.

# Disclaimer

I'm just a guy on the internet writing some code, so you shoudn't this as the only source to plan your dive.
